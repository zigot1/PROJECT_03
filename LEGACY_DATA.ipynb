      "1. Shredded leaf mulch was specified in the planting details (see sheet L07-01 and General Note #10), however shredded hardwood mulch was installed in the field. Hardwood mulch does not occur in nature and it does not naturally decompose at the rate of leaf mulch. As this material is applied year after year, the mulch profile grows in depth from 2\" to 4\" to 6\" etc. This will eventually kill many of the forbs and grasses, causing decay and crown rot. The goal of the planting is to fill in, reducing need for mulch. Leave the hardwood mulch in place but apply 2\" shredded leaf mulch in spring. Discontinue the use of bark mulch! \n",

Hardwood mulch does not occur in nature and it does not naturally decompose at the rate of leaf mulch. As this material is applied year after year, the mulch profile grows in depth from 2\" to 4\" to 6\" etc. This will eventually kill many of the forbs and grasses, causing decay and crown rot. The goal of the planting is to fill in, reducing need for mulch. Leave the hardwood mulch in place but apply 2\" shredded leaf mulch in spring. Discontinue the use of bark mulch! \n",

Hardwood mulch does not occur in nature and it does not naturally decompose at the rate of leaf mulch. As this material is applied year after year, the mulch profile grows in depth from 2\" to 4\" to 6\" etc. This will eventually kill many of the forbs and grasses, causing decay and crown rot. The goal of the planting is to fill in, reducing need for mulch. Leave the hardwood mulch in place but apply 2\" shredded leaf mulch in spring. Discontinue the use of bark mulch! \n",

Due to the tight tolerances of the opening the installers struggled with spiking the last unit.  The gasket kept binding after many attempts at setting the unit.  The setting crew removed the gasket while the unit was suspended and installed the unit without it.    There was sealant residue on the aluminum (where the gasket was removed) and it did not appear there would be a clean seal by gasket on the adjacent unit.

Hardwood mulch does not occur in nature and it does not naturally decompose at the rate of leaf mulch. As this material is applied year after year, the mulch profile grows in depth from 2\" to 4\" to 6\" etc. This will eventually kill many of the forbs and grasses, causing decay and crown rot. The goal of the planting is to fill in, reducing need for mulch. Leave the hardwood mulch in place but apply 2\" shredded leaf mulch in spring. Discontinue the use of bark mulch! \n",

The rigging on the lifts all appears good and I did not see any bad rigging from what I looked at.  I was also glad to see a forklift jib so I know that they have the ability to do the proper lifting for erecting material with a forklift if they use it that way. For the lack of better place to discuss this, the panel braces are missing the blue \"Do Not Remove\" tape.  There was none available on site, so we ordered some.  When it arrives, they will tie the blue tape to the braces.  Until that is done, this item will be marked \"At Risk\".\n",

      "The spray cans are labelled, maybe not in the best way, but they meet the current standards.  One of the more sensitive items is the needs to go dustless on Clayco projects when working on concrete with grinders, saws, or hammer drills.  While the individual employees are protected from the dust created by these operations with respirators, workers around them and down wind are being exposed to this dust.  The cost for vacuum shrouds or wet cut saws are very cheap (around $50-$75 for a vacuum shroud for a 4\" grinder).  But, this project did not have in there contract that it should be a dustless project.  In the last two pictures, the amount of dust created by a saw can be seen.  I am marking this as an \"At Risk\" that some better planning needs to be done to reduce expose to employees downwind of concrete dust creation.  This especially needs to be addressed prior to doing this type of work where they are starting to enclose an area and there is a lack of air movement.\n",

There is a sequence of testing where first you do the air leakage, then static water, then dynamic water, then structural load, then you re-check air and water to make sure that the structural loading (at 50% and 100% of design load) did not adversely affect the air and water performance.  (It did not.)  then you run the structural load again at 75% and 150% of the design loads to check for permanent set in the framing.  You also look for fastener breakage.  On the 150% test, there was a loud popping noise about ¾ of the way through the load application.  Nothing was cracked, broken or damaged.  No members took a set.

The sign type was conceived to identify the sections to the right, left, and behind the vomitory. In these instances, the position of the EXIT sign required the center number be removed. As a result, the section number on one end of these locations does not match the adjacent ID33 sign and identifies a seating section that is several steps away. We would suggest that these numbers be replaced to match the adjacent ID33 section. There is no immediate solution to the identification of the sections that occupy the infill vomitory areas. These sections are to be located with the assistance of the ushers and by their position between known sections. We can discuss additional solutions if necessary.\n",

      "On 4/16/15 Turner/Clayco notified TT of an issue regarding the mechanical tunnels that were installed in Phase 1 located along radial grids 15e & 16e, 34e &35e and 38e &39e at the interface between the original mechanical tunnels. The Bid Package 2 Contract Documents required that the existing B Level Concourse slab and existing mechanical tunnel walls be demolished at the same time (Ref: 1/SD- 311.2). Currently, the extent of demolition varies from this detail.  At 15e-16e, the slab and wall have been demolished but a portion of the slab above the original tunnel wall remains. AT 34e-35e and 38e-39e, only the existing mechanical tunnel walls have been demolished.  The existing slabs that are adjacent to and above the existing tunnel walls remain in place (See Photos 40, 41, 42). This creates a support condition for these slabs that neither the original nor the current design has evaluated or verified. Based on this, TT requested that the live load access be restricted at and below these slab areas until temporary shoring is installed. Turner/Clayco requested TT to determine if the slabs that have not been demolished can remain. Subsequent to the this discussion, Turner/Clayco provide photo documentation via email on 4/17/15 that implies the specific reinforcement noted in Section 9/S-310.1 was not installed (See Photos 43 and 44). Based on the current constructed conditions, further demolition and/or redesign will be required at the location where the radial tunnels interface the existing mechanical tunnel at the grid lines described herein. \n",

To date we have yet to receive, review or approve any slide bearing embed plate or slide bearing assembly shop drawings, even though we have requested this information be submitted several times.  At the time of the visit, the BP1A contractor had already completed their work at the locations mentioned previously without approved shop drawings.  There is no documented evidence or photos showing that the lower ¼ plate and Teflon pad, or upper 20GA. stainless steel plate were installed and stitch welded to the embed plates per the structural details (RE: 8/S504.1). Upon visual inspection of these locations from underneath, there was no horizontal separation seen at the slide bearing locations, and appeared to have concrete preventing the joint from properly moving.  The horizontal separation should have been voided out in some manner, typically done with Styrofoam.  The BP1A contractor needs to confirm what was installed at these locations.  The BP2 contractor needs to submit the required information prior to pouring these support locations.  In general, the embed plates need to be cleaned prior to installing and stitch welding the respective bearing surfaces, and the separation around the slide bearings between the haunch and slab void formed.

      "The pit slab of an existing pit on the Mechanical Level near Gird A29 was partially demolished in order to install a new 4 diameter by 8 deep fiberglass basin. A minor amount of excavation had also occurred.  In addition, water has seeped into the nominal amount of excavation performed in the pit.  See Photo 52.    Based on further review by TT, it was determined that the intended location and depth for this basin would potentially undermine the existing spread footing A29. TT recommended placing the center of the basin at the midpoint between columns A29 and A28 and as close as possible to the court side wall of the existing pit. TT understands that the top of the basin will be approximately flush with the existing 6 curb around the pit.  TT requests that after the basin is installed that a lean concrete mix (Minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi) be placed in the excavated area around the fiberglass basin up to the top of the existing pit slab elevation.

      "2.      curbs need to be raised to accommodate a reasonable height .\n",
      "\n",
      "08/18/2015 - Last April, The issue was brought up that the concrete at the east skylights was not poured with a structural slope that created a high point between the skylights creating a slope to the roof drains.  Indeed the lowest points on the deck happened to be the points farthest from the drains.  I have no clue what RFIs, RFPs, ASIs or what ever followed, and I really dont care.  All I know is that today I visited the site to see the remedy, and all that has been done is a few pieces of loose laid insulation were laid on top of the water proofing and drainage mat laid over the top of them.    This is perfectly useless.  If water gets below the topping slab, it will pond in the low spot and never find its way to the drain.   There needs to be waterproofing ON TOP OF  what ever is creating the taper.  The gentlemen on site this morning  said they couldnt put hot waterproofing on top of polystyrene insulation.  Fair enough.   I asked why grout wasnt used to create a slope and the answer was that the contractor wouldnt be able to waterproof on top of the newly poured grout.  Well, had grout been poured in April, that would not have been the case because there would have been plenty of time between April and now for grout or concrete to cure.  Now we would have to rely on a cold applied product that is compatible with the hot applied.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So the choices are :\n",
      "1.\t Grout poured on top of the existing waterproofing providing a slope to the drain \n",
      "Cold applied waterproofing compatible with the existing hot applied system.  I am not sure if Carlisle was used.  I am fairly certain that Grunloh used Carlisle, but not sure if Poetker used Carlisle.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2.\tTapered polyisocyanurate (not polystyrene) insulation providing slope to drain.  This needs to be a real tapered insulation lay-out.   They need to be glued to the surface below.  The high point needs to be 2 ½ high.  \n",
      "Hot applied waterproofing of the same system as the waterproofing below completely covering the insulation and tied into the wall waterproofing, the curb waterproofing and the deck waterproofing below to create a watertight enclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "A total if 2 ½ will be added at the highest point  tapering to 0 to create the necessary slope.  And , as noted last  April, the height on the wall of the termination bar of the waterproofing system must be a minimum of 8 above the top of the TOPPING SLAB.  That is not where it is now.     \n",

The demolition was requested to allow for pipes to extend from the Mechanical Level up to the B-Level Concourse adjacent to this beam. The allowable demolition of the ledge was limited to between grids Ae and Be. The actual demolition of the ledge inappropriately extended further south of grid Ae. In addition, the demolition process removed more of the beams cross section than just the projecting ledge. TT immediately notified Turner/Clayco of this condition. Per the request of TT, temporary shoring was installed below the existing beam.As a result of the unauthorized demolition, repairs are required for this beam. See Photos 1-4.\n",
